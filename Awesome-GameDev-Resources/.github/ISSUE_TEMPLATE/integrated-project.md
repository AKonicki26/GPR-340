## Communication
It's important to have a clear communication with the collaborators. Setup an environment so the collabs and the community can follow up how the project is evolving. Use online medias (Discord, Whatsapp) and online sharing files.

## Teamwork
Remember that this project should be made with the collabs and some are doing to gain experience and know-how. Work with them to achieve goals and encourage them into the area to explore and grow.

## Keep the good work
Try to keep the schedule as persistant as you can. We all know that communities sometimes can be put aside, but for some they're everything in their view. With that in mind try to have regular meetings, discuss the problems, make adjustments in the project and at last but not least try to finish the project.

## Finishing the project
When finally done, show off your work to the community. Get feedback. So we all can celebrate your achievement :D
