# Coding Dojo Definition

A coding dojo is a programming practice that involves a group of developers coming together to collaborate on solving coding challenges. It is a learning and collaborative environment where developers can improve their coding skills and work on real-world coding problems.

The term "dojo" comes from the Japanese term for `place of the way`, which is a traditional place of training for martial arts. In a coding dojo, participants practice the skills they have learned, exchange knowledge and experience, and work together to solve programming challenges.

During a coding dojo session, participants work in pairs or small groups to solve programming challenges, using techniques such as pair programming and test-driven development. They work through the problem step by step, discussing and sharing their ideas and approaches along the way. The goal of a coding dojo is to improve individual and team coding skills, and to learn from each other's experiences.
