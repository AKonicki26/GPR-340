## Late policy

Every day an assignment is late your maximum grade will be reduced by 1% up to 25 days, after that you will receive a flat 25% penalty.

My goal is to grade the assignments no later than 1 week after submission, but in exceptional cases where I am struggling with lots of submissions, it could take 2 weeks maximum (in my career this has happened twice). Late submissions will be graded only once I finish grading all the others.

If you have any accommodations and want to use your rights, or if you are facing any personal issues (no need to state what it is), I will grant extra time or grade fairly only if you send a comment on Canvas in the assignment before the deadline. Feel free to book meetings with me if you need to talk about it.
