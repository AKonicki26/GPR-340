# Advanced Programming

This course builds on the content from Introduction to Programming. Students study the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Paradigm with topics such as objects, classes, encapsulation, abstraction, modularity, inheritance, and polymorphism. Students examine and use structures such as arrays, structs, classes, and linked lists to model complex information. Pointers and dynamic memory allocation are covered, as well as principles such as overloading and overriding. Students work to solve problems by selecting implementation options from competing alternatives.

Upon completion of the Advanced Programming course in C++, students should be able to:

- **Articulate** key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), including objects, classes, encapsulation, abstraction, modularity, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Exhibit** a comprehensive **understanding** of the OOP paradigm and its fundamental principles.
- **Differentiate** between various structures (arrays, structs, classes, and linked lists) and proficiently apply them in modeling complex information.
- **Apply** OOP principles effectively to design and implement solutions for real-world problems.
- **Utilize** Pointers and Dynamic Memory Allocation.
- Effectively **employ** pointers and dynamic memory allocation in C++ programming.
- **Analyze** and **evaluate** competing alternatives for implementation options when solving programming problems.
Break down complex problems into manageable components using OOP concepts.
- **Evaluate** the effectiveness of different implementation strategies in addressing programming challenges.
- Critically **assess** the advantages and disadvantages of using structures like arrays, structs, classes, and linked lists in specific scenarios.
- **Develop** solutions for programming challenges by integrating and synthesizing various OOP principles.
- **Implement** advanced programming concepts, such as overloading and overriding, to enhance code functionality.
