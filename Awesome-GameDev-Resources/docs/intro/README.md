# Intro to Programming

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the fundamental concepts of programming and computer science;
- Practice how to solve problems programatically using C++;
- Use tools to write and compile C++ programs;
- Code, document, test, and implement a well-structured, robust computer program using the C++ programming language.
- Write reusable modules (collections of functions).
- Use version control to manage your code;
- Use the debugger to find and fix bugs in your code;
- Understand the basics of file input/output;
- Work in groups to solve problems;

## Learning Outcomes
