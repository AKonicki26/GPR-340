# Final project

Your portfolio should be a hosted webpage and a open repository on github.

You should follow a portfolio [structure](../03-structure/README.md), to build a [website](../10-frontend/README.md) and [host](../07-hosting/README.md) it publicly. It should have a nice [style](../05-style/README.md), a good [communication](../04-communication/README.md) is the key to execute and analyse your [strategy](../06-strategy/README.md) in order to capture insights. You can optionally increment your portfolio via [dynamic content](../11-dynamic/README.md) such as blogs or whatever you find relevant. Another extra step would be to create a generic [cover letter](../13-cover-letter/README.md) to express your intentions and goals more personally. Note that some game companies still require [CVs](../14-cv/README.md) To boost your visualization, you can [promote](../12-promoting/README.md).

Minimum steps:
1. Have a domain or at least a meaningful github username/organization; 
2. Create a github repository; 
3. Push your frontend to the repo;
4. Enable github pages; 
5. Create a CI/CD to build and deploy to gh pages; 
6. Point your domain to gh-pages if you have one;

It is expected to have something to showcase, so it is expected to have at least 3 projects to showcase. It is preferable to showcase something that could be testable(webgl builds) or watchable in a lightweight manner.

If you are willing to showcase your ability in Unity, I recommend you to try GameCI and github pages. If you want to showcase your game engine abilities with C++, I recommend you using CMake, SDL2 and emscripten to build and deploy  for github pages.

If you want to start something from scratch you can use [this repo](https://github.com/InfiniBrains/SDL2-CPM-CMake-Example) to start have a SDL2 project with all libraries already set. It builds and publish a Github page via Github actions automatically,  you can check it running [here](https://infinibrains.github.io/SDL2-CPM-CMake-Example/). It features CMake tooling, IMGUI for debug interfaces, SDL2, SDL2_ttf, SDL_image, SDL_mixer,
