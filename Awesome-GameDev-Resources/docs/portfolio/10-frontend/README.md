# Frontend frameworks

There are many frontend frameworks floating around, but in order to speed up your learning curve on how to deploy a fully customized webpage, I am going to use this combination of technologies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for building website;
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for tooling;
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling;

Some examples with this stack:
